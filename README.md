# **☔ Weather Data Analysis using Python**

This project focuses on the analysis of weather data captured over the course of a year (2012) at a specific location. The dataset includes hourly observations, recorded in a CSV file, containing several weather parameters such as temperature, dew point temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, and weather conditions. The goal of the analysis was to clean, process, and extract meaningful insights from the dataset using Python's Pandas library, a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis. Key tasks include identifying patterns, computing statistical summaries, handling missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends in weather data. The analysis also includes weather condition distributions, the effects of wind speed on visibility, and the relationship between pressure and temperature.



## Project Overview 📃
The main objectives of this project are:
- Import and clean the dataset.
- Explore and analyze key weather metrics.
- Perform time-series-based observations to uncover trends and patterns.
- Visualize data to understand relationships between different weather attributes.
## Dataset Description 📀
The dataset contains the following columns:
1. *Temperature*
2. *Dew Point Temperature*
3. *Relative Humidity*
4. *Wind Speed*
5. *Visibility*
6. *Pressure*
7. *Weather Conditions*

The data is stored in CSV format and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
## Features and Highlights ✨
- **Data Exploration**:
  - View dataset structure (`head`, `tail`, `shape`).
