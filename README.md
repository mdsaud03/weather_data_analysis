# **☔ Weather Data Analysis using Python**

This project involves analyzing a time-series weather dataset with per-hour information about weather conditions at a specific location. 

The dataset records various attributes such as Temperature, Dew Point Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure, and Weather Conditions. 

The analysis is performed using Python and its powerful libraries, focusing on data manipulation and exploratory data analysis.

## Project Overview 📃
The main objectives of this project are:
- Import and clean the dataset.
- Explore and analyze key weather metrics.
- Perform time-series-based observations to uncover trends and patterns.
- Visualize data to understand relationships between different weather attributes.
## Dataset Description 📀
The dataset contains the following columns:
1. *Temperature*
2. *Dew Point Temperature*
3. *Relative Humidity*
4. *Wind Speed*
5. *Visibility*
6. *Pressure*
7. *Weather Conditions*

The data is stored in CSV format and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
## Features and Highlights ✨
- **Data Exploration**:
  - View dataset structure (`head`, `tail`, `shape`).
